# Simulating Evolution
- Simulation basic evolution

### Concept:
- A basic simulation
- "Animals" are spawned with a high visible color
- Each round, the most visible ones will be eaten
- But the others reproduce themselves asexually
- Each new animal has a chance to mutate, causing a slightly change of their skin color
- The goal is to create a population with their skin color matching the background color.


- Inspired by a species that changed their skin color over time.

### Procedure:
1) Initial setup
Repeat:
2) Killing the most visible ones (natural selection)
3) Reproducing -> Chance for mutation -> Change of skin color
